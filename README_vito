The output ROOT file of the analysis SignalIntegralFEBV2_<dataset>_<subdataset>.root has a folder for each run.
Each folder has several TNtuples.
The TNtuple ADRIANOParam is different from others.
This has a list of parameters that are obtained from configurations in AnalysisIntegralFEBV2.C macro or from the data filename.
This TNtuple also has a map of channels that can be useful in case not all channels are selected for the analysis.
In his TNtuple the content of ch# is the actual channel represented by ch#.

Other TNtuples elements are ch# and evt.
evt is the event index, while ch# has the value of the parameter represented by the TNtuple for the given channel.

TNtuples description:
ADRIANOAmp provides the peak amplitude
ADRIANOTimeAmp provides the time corresponding to the peak amplitude
  this can indicate if the peak is in the expected time region
ADRIANOIntegral provides the integral of the signal
  this can indicate if the peak belongs to a good signal, or if the peak is just an electronic spike
ADRIANOPed provides the pedestal level, this is evaluated taking into account initial bins of the signal waveform
  this indicates what is the baseline level to subtract to the signal amplitude to get the real amplitude
ADRIANOPedSigma provides the sigma of the pedestal distribution
  if the baseline signal is stable, this sigma should be very small
ADRIANOFitCheck is used to provide a binary mask for a list of check for each channel.
